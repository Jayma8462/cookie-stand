    <h1>From the start</h1>
    <p>We started working in my friend Pat's house baking things for local bake sales to make ends meet but as we know this is a slow process and has very little growth. One day pat was making a batch of cookies and cooking some dinner for his family at the same time. Well he ended up burning the salmon and thought he could get away with just cutting off the burnt part and serving it, but his family was not having any of that. So he set the salmon aside because he did not want to throw it out.</p>
    <p>He desided he was going to make some patties with the discarded salmon so he began to grind the meat down. When he was done he intended to put it into the batter mixure for the patties and he accidently put it into the cookie mixture. without knowing it he mixed up the cookie dough and the salmon and cooked them like normal. Well when we were trying the cookies it had a very abnormal taste to it, almost like a salty fishy taste AND IT WAS AMAZING! Then he realized that he put the fish in the wrong batter and accidently put them in the cookies.</p>
    <p>Well after that night Pat decided to make the batch of salmon cookies for another bake sale not knowing what the results would be. We set the tables up like normal and no one was buying the cookies because they looked liek any other cookie on other tables. There was one though about an hour before we had to pack up. she wanted a cookie and most of the otehr tables were on scraps so she gave ours a try. Well we know what happened after that. She called a large group of her friends who also tried the salmon cookies and they all absolutly loved them. After that word began to spread and we opened up our first store shortly after. We were getting so many orders that we got enough to open our own bakery. Of course it is one of our highlights but we also have all types of baked goods out there.</p>
    <p>Now we have 6 stores located in many locations all over the Seattle area, and all of Pat's stored are always busy. People order all types of products that all started out on a simple bake sale at a farmers market. We hope to go nation wide and incorperate baked goods from all over the world one day. But right now we want the people of Seattle to enjoy the cookies a little bit longer because Seattle is where my home is and a place i will always enjoy.</p>
